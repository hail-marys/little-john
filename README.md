## Web Application

As a group we created an AI stock market trading bot using python. Customers will be able to log into their account to view current trades and balances through the terminal along with past trading history. Customers will also be able to search for a companies stock price and history by searching either the companies name or symbol. Customers will be able to turn the auto trading bot on and off.
